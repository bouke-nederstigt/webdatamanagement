\section{Introduction}
For this project we chose to investigate the use of HADOOP as a tool for large scale data management. This report gives an overview of the different experiments that we ran and their results. Some code and query excerpts will be shown in the report but the entire source code will be available on our \href{https://github.com/bouke-nederstigt/webdatamanagement}{GitHub repository} (https://github.com/bouke-nederstigt/webdatamanagement). The repository also contains a README file that contains source code installation instructions for each of the applications.

\subsection{Software and Tools}
We faced some difficulties with software versions and compiling code as a result of incompatible packages. The table below lists the main software components that were used during this project.
