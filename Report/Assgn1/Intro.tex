\section{Introduction}
For this project we chose to investigate the use of eXist as an XML database. This report gives an overview of the different experiments that we ran and their results. Some code and query excerpts will be shown in the report but the entire source code will be available at the following GitHub repository:


https://github.com/bouke-nederstigt/webdatamanagement


The repository also contains a README file that contains source code installation instructions for each of the applications discussed below.
