\section{Future Improvements to MusicXML Online Application}

It was nice to conduct an experiment where all the tools for converting music XML files into pdf and audio were put together. A lot of future extensions could be added to make this web application more robust and they are listed as follows:

\begin{itemize}
\item Highlighting lyrics when a song is playing
\item Extraction of extra information like melody or author information
\item Creating a more elaborate and robust search functionality by correctly retrieving the song lyrics
\item Improved file upload procedure
\item Currently the application only accepts XML files but MXL files seem to be a more common format. The implementation of this could be done within a short timeframe because the mxl files are basically just zipped XML files. Unfortunately it was not possible to achieve this within the deadline of the project.
\item Some steps would need to be taken before the application could be used in a production environment. User input should be validated (right now files are uploaded straight to the server) and error handling could also be improved.
\end{itemize}
